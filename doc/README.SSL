In order to use SSL with ntopng (i.e. HTTPS) you need to

1. Install OpenSSL
   On OSX do: brew install openssl

2. Create your SSL certificate
   make cert

3. OPTIONAL
   Depending on the distribution and packager you might need
   this optional step. 

   Copy in the directory where ntopng is running
   the shared libraries needed to enable SSL.

   - Linux
   ln -s /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libssl.so .
   Note that this symbolic link is NOT necessary on all linux
   distros. Example it is not required on Fedora Linux.
   Please check this according to your distribution.

   - OSX
   ln -s /usr/local/Cellar/openssl/1.0.1i/lib/libcrypto.dylib .
   ln -s /usr/local/Cellar/openssl/1.0.1i/lib/libssl.dylib .
   
4. Edit ntop.conf to enable https
   Edit the /etc/ntopng/ntopng.conf file to include the text --https-port=3001
   You may choose ports other than 3001 but it must be a different port to the http port which is port 3000 by default
   Alternatively you can disable insecure http altogether by replacing the line -w=3000 with --http-port=0
   (-w and --http-port are interchangeable)
   

5. Start ntopng
  "make cert" will create the certificate but you can see below the
  exact steps if you want to generate the certificate manually.
  
  You now need to locate your ntopng `share` directory. It is usually located at `/usr/share/ntopng` or at `/usr/local/share/ntopng`.
  The next instructions assume it's located at `/usr/local/share/ntopng`.

== Ubuntu and Centos packages ==

  cd /tmp/
  openssl req -new -x509 -sha256 -extensions v3_ca -nodes -days 365 -out cert.pem
  cat privkey.pem cert.pem > /usr/local/share/ntopng/httpdocs/ssl/ntopng-cert.pem
  /bin/rm -f privkey.pem cert.pem
  cd /usr/local/bin/
  ln -s /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libssl.so .
  ntopng

== HomeBrew Formula ==

  cd /tmp/
  openssl req -new -x509 -sha256 -extensions v3_ca -nodes -days 365 -out cert.pem
  mkdir /usr/local/share/ntopng/httpdocs/ssl/
  cat privkey.pem cert.pem > /usr/local/share/ntopng/httpdocs/ssl/ntopng-cert.pem
  /bin/rm -f privkey.pem cert.pem
  cd /usr/local/bin/
  ln -s /opt/local/lib/libssl.dylib /opt/local/lib/libcrypto.dylib .
  ntopng
