Introduction
------------
This readme explains how to integrate ntopng with http://influxdb.org time series database.
Influx is populated by ntopng periodically pushing data into it, using the TimeSeriesExporter class.

*** NOTE: ntopng requires influxdb features only available in the latest versions 1.5.x and up . ***
Please install influxdb from the official packages `https://portal.influxdata.com/downloads`.

Installation
------------
By default Influx data export is disabled. You can enabled as follows:

1. execute

$ influx
Connected to http://localhost:8086 version 1.5.1
InfluxDB shell version: 1.5.1
> CREATE DATABASE ntopng;
> 

2. from the ntopng Timeseries preferences, select "InfluxDB" as the Timeseries Database
3. set the `InfluxDB URL` to point to the database: http://<host where Influx is running>:8086"
4. click save

and then ntopng will push data to Influx.

At this point ntop will use InfluxDB (and not RRD) to store timeseries. As you have exported data onto InfluxDB
you can also use Chronograf or Grafana to access your traffic metrics produced by ntopng.
