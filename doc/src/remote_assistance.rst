Remote Assistance
=================

A common problem when requesting remote assistance is to get access to the user machine.
Usually the user machine is behind a NAT or a firewall which blocks incoming connections,
and it a problem for the non-technical user to setup port forwarding and firewall rules.

In order to ease remote assistance, ntopng integrates n2n_ and provides a web console
to enable remote access. This console is only available in the following linux distributions:

- Centos 7
- Ubuntu 16
- Ubuntu 18

The console can be accessed from the `Remote Assistance` menu entry:

When the remote assistance is enabled, a unique key is generated. This key should
only be provided to the ntop team via a *secure channel* (e.g. email).

.. warning::
  The secrecy of the remote assistance key is critical to avoid unauthorized access to the device

By enabling the remote assistance and providing the secret key to the ntop support
team, the user machine will be part of a dedicated virtual network which can be used
by the support team to connect to it, **bypassing NAT and firewalls**.

.. warning::

   ntop is not responsible for any damage, security violation or vulnerability caused by enabling remote assistance

.. warning::

   It is the user responsability to ensure that the network security policies allow virtual networks creation

If the `Enable Admin Access` flag is checked, then the support team will also be able
to connect to ntopng gui as the admin user. If it's not enabled, then gui credentials
must be provided to the support team by the user.

As long as the remote assistance is active, an icon will be displayed in the footer:

The remote assistance service will stay active even when ntopng is stopped. This
must be manually disabled from the ntopng gui when remote assistance is concluded.

Security Considerations
-----------------------

Here are some consideration about the remote assistance security:

- All the traffic is end-to-end encrypted to prevent MITM attacks
- The remote assistance is automatically disabled after 24 hours
- By enabling remote assistance, the support team *will not have* console access
  to the machine. Console access, if necessary, must be manually configured by the user.
- Traffic forwarding via the virtual network interface is disabled to increase security
