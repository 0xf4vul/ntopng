ntopng categorizes hosts in good/malware hosts by exploiting the google safe browsing API
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Safe_Browsing

In order to use these categorization services you need to obtain a key from Google
at https://developers.google.com/safe-browsing/key_signup

Once you have the key available, you can start
ntopng -c KEY ...

You can test a malware site by visiting (at your risk) ianfette.org
